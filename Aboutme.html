      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="padding-bottom: 60px">
        Hello! My name is Tom Studley. I'm grew up in Sydney's Inner West
        in Australia, now studying psychology at the Australian National
        University. One of my favourite past-times is getting lost
        in the worlds of fantasy and sci-fi novels, movies and games. I have gained a
        deep appreciation for the immersive capability of computer graphics. It
        is my dream to be able to render fantastic, new worlds that others can
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2>My Passion</h2>
      <p class="bodylink">
        On the <a href="Artworks.html">Gallery</a> page, you can view personal projects that I have created using the program Blender. (some may be labelled placeholders)</p>

        <a href="blender.org">Blender</a> is a 3D creative software that allows
        modelling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing,
        motion tracking, and much more. Blender is the go-to for beginners in 3D
        graphics. It serves as an all-purpose, artistic and professional design
        medium. It is also completely free, open source, and has a more flexible
        and beginner-friendly interface than comparable software like Maya.

        My website is as a platform for learners and
        general users of Blender. Specifically, it is for those who want to
        discovering interesting elements and techniques that they can apply in
        their own projects, and perhaps also learn skills while doing so.

        The <a href="guide.html">Guidebook</a> contains a compilation of hand-picked beginner-friendly tutorials where the objective is to
        inspire creativity. I believe that the best way to learn is as consequence of doing something you enjoy, rather than for its own sake. You could bore yourself following a 10 hour, ad-filled tutorial course to create a regular glazed
        donut, or you could spend a few hours creating this awesome wireframe
        donut.

        Each post includes my own description of the element, and an
        embedded link to the tutorial. In the same way that you might prefer
        listening to somebody elseâ€™s hand-picked music playlist rather than wade
        through popular music recommended by an algorithm, users might like my
        style and want to stick around.</p>
